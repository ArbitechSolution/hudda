In short, users lock up their tokens into a participating DeFi app, and in exchange for this service the project automatically reward these “yield farmers” in crypto over time.</p>
                        <p class="para">Now that you've acquired STARS-BNB LP tokens which you're receiving rewards on, you can then head over to either Wondercoin or Beefy Finance (list may be updated in the future) to further farm these tokens. 


						Simply head to the Pool page on either site and search for STARS. You will then see the STARS-BNB pools, the rewards they're giving, along with an interface you can use to add your LP tokens to the pool.</p>
